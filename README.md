# LoLCounterPicking
This is a personal project in order to simplify the process of counter-picking in League of Legends. 
All data comes from the website, lolcounter.com, and the champion images come from ddragon.leagueoflegends.com.
This project is being hosted publicly, but I do not take any responsibility for those accessing this website without my knowledge.
